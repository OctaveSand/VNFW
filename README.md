#VNFW

VNFW is a light framework for making sandbox-style Renpy games. It builds on
the renpy framework to provide a set of classes and convienience functions to
enable the dev to focus on implementing storyline rather than things like
game-time, RPG-style stats-tracking, inventory, clothing, and money systems.
All of these entities are represented by classes in VNFW. The dev can implement
the objects she needs and move on with the story.
